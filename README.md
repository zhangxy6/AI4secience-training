The project of the original code from https://doi.org/10.1038/s43246-021-00194-3, thanks for sharing the original author, let me be used to carry out the stiffness tensor of prediction. 
I prepared the input file, then added the Cholesky layer, and then debugged the parameters so that the model could output a 6 by 6 matrix.I wrote a script to generate the input data('./prepare_input/prepare_input_data.py')
 Other code is from the original author.
